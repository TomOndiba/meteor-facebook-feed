# meteor-facebook-feed
Meteor application for retrieving and displaying a Facebook page feed using Masonry cascading grid layout.

Currently we support:
- Displaying Facebook page feed
- Infinite scroll to load more posts
- Searching in the Facebook page using keywords
- Changing the Facebook page
- Refreshing posts

Notes:
- No database required since we don't store any posts information on the server
- Most of the logic is on the client side and the server only makes the requests to the Graph API.

You can see the demo at http://meteor-facebook-feed.icenodes.com

# Why

We are building a lot of internal projects and external projects like Startup MVPs and we needed a social feed aggregator and a cool way of displaying the posts.
